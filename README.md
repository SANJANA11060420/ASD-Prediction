# Prediction of Autism using Machine Learning


Autism Spectrum Disorder-ASD-a neuro developmental condition, is mostly joined with issues from sensory which means, sensitivity towards hearing, smell and touch. With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML), the prediction of a child being Autistic is possible at quite an early stage. 
The major part of the existing literature on autism spectrum disorder is covered by a prediction system based on traditional machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tress, Logistic Regression and the proposed models are validated by using performance measurement parameters such as accuracy and precision.
