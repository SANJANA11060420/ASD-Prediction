# Prediction of Autism using Machine Learning

🧩 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition often accompanied by unique sensory experiences — including increased sensitivity to sound 🔊, smell 👃, and touch ✋. Early detection is crucial, and thanks to the incredible strides in Artificial Intelligence 🤖 and Machine Learning (ML) 📊, predicting the possibility of a child being on the spectrum is now more achievable than ever — and at a much earlier stage.

📚 Most of the existing research in this field leans on traditional machine learning models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest 🌳, Decision Trees 🌲, and Logistic Regression ➗. These models are typically validated using performance measures like accuracy 🎯 and precision 📏, ensuring reliable outcomes that aid early diagnosis.
